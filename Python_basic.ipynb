        "# Q1.What is python and why it is popular?\n",
        "\n",
        "\"\"\" Ans: Python is a programming language which is help to commnuciate with computer. It is simple and reliable language.\n",
        "There are some reasons that are popular\n",
        "1.Easy to Learn and Read\n",
        "2.Versatile and Flexible\n",
        "3.Large Community and Support\n",
        "4.Rich Libraries and Frameworks \"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q2.What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "\"\"\" Ans: Python interpreter is a program that read and excutes python code.\n",
        "When we run python program the interpeter read the code line by line and executes.\n",
        "When we create a python file with .py extension\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "\"\"\" Ans: It is also called as a reserved words which is already define in python language. These keywords cannot used as a identifiers such as variables names, functions names because its reservered as a python interpreters. ['False', 'None', 'True', 'and', 'as', 'assert', 'async', 'await', 'break', 'class', 'continue', 'def', 'del', 'elif', 'else', 'except', 'finally', 'for', 'from', 'global', 'if', 'import', 'in', 'is', 'lambda', 'nonlocal', 'not', 'or', 'pass', 'raise', 'return', 'try', 'while', 'with', 'yield'] \"\"\"\n",

        "# Q5.What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "\"\"\"Ans: Mutability means their values can changes and modified.\n",
        "such as Lists,Dictionaries,sets \"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q6 Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "\"\"\"Ans Because when list is created in Python we can change and modified because when we assign the list memory is designed to be expandable for removing,addition in memory block.\n",
        "But in the tuples has fixed memory block that why we cannot changes and modified in the tuples . \"\"\"\n",

        "\"Is\" It is a identify operator Checks if two variables refer to the same object in memory.\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",

        "# Q9.What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "\"\" Ans: Type casting is also known as type conversion, is the process of changing data types of a value from one type to another type. For example interger to string \"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q10.What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "\"\"\" Ans. Implicit type casting : Python automatically convert some data types without using code that is called implicit type conversioon.\n",
        "Explicit type conversion : In this type casting, We use built in function to convert value of data types.\n",
        "int()\n",

        "\"\"\"Ans : The purpose of conditional statements are Decision making,Selection execution, Control flow.\n",
        "if, elif,else, these are the conditional statements.\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q12 How does the elif statement work?\n",

        "\"\"\" Ans: While loops: While loops are condition-based: They continue to execute as long as a specified condition remains True. This flexibility makes them ideal when the number of iterations is unknown or depends on user interaction.\n",
        "For loops: For loops are typically used for definite iterations: They are most suitable when you know the exact number of times you need to repeat a block of code or when you're iterating through a sequence with a fixed length.\"\"\""
